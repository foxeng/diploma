\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

For this work, signalling the completion of a long course, I would like to thank
the members of the computing systems laboratory, under whose auspices it was
carried out. Most of all, I want to thank them, as well as other members of the
ECE school, for their teaching, their genuine interest and for cultivating the
spirit of an engineer in me.

Moreover, I owe a big thank you to the people in the \osv{} and \viofs{}
communities for their support, their guidance and their time, but more
importantly for their openness, their spirit and work which sparked this
contribution.

Finally, those I am most grateful for are my family and friends, who always
stand on my side, bear with and support me and without whom nothing could
be accomplished.
